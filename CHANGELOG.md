## [Unreleased]

### ADDED

`Embeddings` endpoint

- Get a vector representation of a given input that can be easily consumed by machine learning models and algorithms. Note that the vectors are NOT normalized.
- Similar to OpenAI's embeddings endpoint
- Resolves #86

Generative Table

- Check existence of Knowledge Table when creating reference in either table creation or update gen_config. Resolves #142.
- Full row data logging when error occurred in table rows add or update. Resolves #140.
- Handle streaming exception by setting `ChatCompletionChunk.finish_reason` as "error". Also applies to chat endpoint.

UI

- Added button to delete projects
- Added title to dashboard
- Added config for building frontend into single-page application
- Setup frontend auth test for future tests

### CHANGED / FIXED

Generative Table

- Conversation Chat table generation config can now be modified. Previously only Agent Chat table can be modified. Resolves #188
- When creating a new table, a LLM model will be assigned dynamically if not specified in its `gen_config`. Resolves #190
- Vector search
  - Change default metric to `cosine`; fixes #110
  - Reduce default `refine_factor` from 50 to 20 to speed up search
- Hybrid search
  - Only do FTS once instead of looping through indexed col one by one (Lance/Tanvity FTS unable to specify search columns); fixes #138
  - Added Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to merge FTS and VS search results without using reranker; fixes #112
  - Added retry to search query, to handle possible failure case during FTS index build; fixes #111
  - Removed hybrid search with linear score combination (only uses RRF if without reranker)
- Improved handling of mid-stream error
  - Any errors encountered mid-stream will yield a completion chunk with error details as `text` and "error" as `finish_reason`
  - Errored table column will have its cell value set to `None`
- Missing columns in table row data are filled with `None`. It used to cause row add failure.
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is now more robust against missing column data.
- Remap internal `ValidationError` to `RequestValidationError`. Fixes #162
- Improved handling of Timeout errors
- More aggressive Lance DB version cleanup: cleanup versions older than 5 minutes by default. Fixes #163
- Added more tests
- Bug fixes
  - If RAG query contains certain keyword in uppercase, it may be interpreted as term search and may lead to `SyntaxError`. It is now escaped. Fixes #187
  - Streaming response was not returning token usage. This also applies to chat endpoint.
  - Reference chunk `object` field value was incorrectly set as "chat.references" instead of "gen_table.references".
  - GenTable column reordering may produce tables with invalid generation config. Fixes #135
  - Stricter generation config validation
