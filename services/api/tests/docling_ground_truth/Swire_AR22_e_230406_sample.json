The Company has a long history in Greater China, where the name Swire or 太古 has been established for over 150 years.\n\nOur aims are to deliver sustainable growth in shareholder value, achieved through sound returns on equity over the long term, and to return value to shareholders through sustainable growth in ordinary dividends.

New areas of growth, such as healthcare and sustainable foods, are being targeted.\n\n## Our Values\n\nIntegrity, endeavour, excellence, humility, teamwork, continuity.\n\n## Our Core Principles\n\n- -  We focus on Asia, principally Greater China, because of its strong growth potential and because it is where the Group has long experience, deep knowledge and strong relationships.\n- -  We mobilise capital, talent and ideas across the Group.

The welfare of our people is critical to our operations.\n- -  We build strong and lasting relationships, based on mutual benefit, with those with whom we do business.\n- -  We invest in sustainable development, because it is the right thing to do and because it supports long-term growth through innovation and improved efficiency.\n- -  We are committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and to the preservation and development of the Swire brand and reputation.\n\n## Our Investment Principles\n\n- -  We aim to build a portfolio of businesses that collectively deliver a steady dividend stream over time.\n- -  We are long-term investors.

businesses that provide high-quality products and services and that are leaders in their markets.\n- -  We divest from businesses which have reached their full potential under our ownership, and

The majority of operating leases in the above table are within the scope of HKFRS 16.\n\n***  The contractual arrangements relating to the freighters operated by Air Hong Kong do not constitute leases in accordance with HKFRS 16.\n\n(a) Two Airbus A321-200neo aircraft were delivered in February 2023.\n\n(b) The plan is to return the nine A300-600F aircraft between 2023 and 2024 and to replace them with nine second-hand A330F aircraft. This allows the Air Hong Kong fleet to remain the same (at 15), at least until 2024.\n\n## Responsibilities of Directors\n\nOn appointment, the Directors receive information about the Group including:\n\n- - the role of the Board and the matters reserved for its attention\n- - the role and terms of reference of Board Committees\n- - the Group's corporate governance practices and procedures\n- - the powers delegated to management and\n- - the latest financial information.\n\nDirectors update their skills, knowledge and understanding of the Company's businesses through their participation at meetings of the Board and its committees and through regular meetings with management at the head office and in the divisions. Directors are regularly updated by the Company Secretary on their legal and other duties as Directors of a listed company.\n\nThrough the Company Secretary, Directors are able to obtain appropriate professional training and advice.\n\nEach Director ensures that he/she can give sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Group. All Directors disclose to the Board on their first appointment their interests as a Director or otherwise in other companies or organisations and such declarations of interests are updated regularly. No Director was a director of more than five other listed companies (excluding the Company) at 31st December 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of Directors' other appointments are shown in their biographies in the section of this annual report headed Directors and Officers.\n\nAgendas and accompanying Board papers are circulated with sufficient time to allow the Directors to prepare before meetings.\n\n## Board Processes\n\nAll committees of the Board follow the same processes as the full Board.\n\nThe dates of the 2022 Board meetings were determined in 2021 and any amendments to this schedule were notified to Directors at least 14 days before regular meetings. Appropriate arrangements are in place to allow Directors to include items in the agenda for regular Board meetings.\n\nThe Board met seven times in 2022, including two strategy sessions. The attendance of individual Directors at meetings of the Board and its committees is set out in the table on page 83. Attendance at Board meetings was 100%. All Directors attended Board meetings in person or through electronic means of communication during the year.\n\nThe Chairman takes the lead to ensure that the Board acts in the best interests of the Company, that there is effective communication with the shareholders and that their views are communicated to the Board as a whole.\n\nBoard decisions are made by vote at Board meetings and supplemented by the circulation of written resolutions between Board meetings.\n\nMinutes of Board meetings are taken by the Company Secretary and, together with any supporting papers, are made available to all Directors. The minutes record the matters considered by the Board, the decisions reached, and any concerns raised or dissenting views expressed by Directors. Draft and final versions of the minutes are sent to all Directors for their comment and records respectively.",
